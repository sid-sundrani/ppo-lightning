# Promixal Policy Optimization with PyTorch  
This repository implements [promixal policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) using the Pytorch Lightning package. 
The PyTorch Lightning helps simplify and modularize the models and training. Parts of it can be easily modified as per users' experiments. 

This implementation is inspired by the OpenAI baselines for [PPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo2) and implementation 
of other RL algorithms in [PyTorch Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning-bolts/)

## Details 
This PPO implemenation works with any discrete or continous environment as long as it is via OpenAI Gym. 

## Requirements 
* Python3 >= 3.6 
* OpenAI Gym 
* PyTorch
* PyTorch Lightning 

## Results 
TBA
